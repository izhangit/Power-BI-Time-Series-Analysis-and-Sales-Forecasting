## What is Power BI (Business Intelligence)?
Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards. It connects to a wide range of data sources and allows for extensive data transformation and modeling.

## Features of Power BI:
- Data Connectivity: Connect to hundreds of data sources.
- Data Transformation: Clean, transform, and model your data with ease.
- Visualizations: Create a wide range of visualizations to explore data insights.
- Dashboards: Build and share interactive dashboards.
- Collaboration: Collaborate and share reports with colleagues.


## Introduction

This project aims to contribute to the success of a business by utilizing data analysis techniques, specifically focusing on time series analysis, to provide valuable insights and accurate sales forecasting.



## Objectives
### 1. Dashboard Creation
- Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Design an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard.
- Add interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities to allow users to explore the data at various levels of granularity.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Provide valuable insights to business entities regarding the effectiveness of their sales strategies through visualizations and charts.

### 3. Sales Forecasting
- Leverage historical data and apply time series analysis to generate sales forecasts for the next 15 days.

### 4. Actionable Insights and Recommendations

- Deliver insights and actionable information that can drive strategic decisions.
- Support the supermarket's goals for growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.


### Project Description
#### Dashboard Creation
The first step involved identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for understanding sales performance. An intuitive dashboard was designed using Power BI to visualize these KPIs. The dashboard includes interactive elements such as filters and drill-down capabilities, enabling users to explore the data at different levels of detail.

#### Data Analysis
Data analysis was conducted to provide insights into sales trends and patterns. Various charts and visualizations were created to help business entities understand the effectiveness of their sales strategies. The visualizations helped in identifying which products were performing well and which needed attention.

#### Sales Forecasting
Using historical sales data, time series analysis techniques were applied to forecast sales for the next 15 days. These forecasts help the business plan inventory, manage stock levels, and prepare for upcoming demand, thereby ensuring efficient operations.

#### Actionable Insights and Recommendations
The end goal was to provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis. These insights help the business make strategic decisions that support growth, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in formulas or expressions to calculate and return values in Power BI. DAX helps create custom calculations in calculated columns and measures to perform advanced data manipulation and analysis.

#### Key Features of DAX:
- Functions: DAX includes a variety of functions to perform calculations, including mathematical, date/time, text, logical, and statistical functions.
- Calculated Columns: Create new columns in your data model using DAX formulas.
- Measures: Create calculations, that are evaluated based on the context of the report.
- Data Manipulation: Aggregate, filter, and manipulate data efficiently.
